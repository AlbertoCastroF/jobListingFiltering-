## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Filter job listings based on the categories

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I want to create react projects that i code myself rather than following a tutorial, so i decided to take this idea as a challenge to practice React. I mostly practiced what i knew about React but one major think i learned is that i can use useEffect to update a state before immediatly passing it to another function wich is a key aspect to the solution of this challenge.

```js
useEffect(() => {
  setBadgeData(filterBadges());
}, [filterTags]);
```

### Continued development

Id like to continue creating bigger projects to wrap my head up around the concept of reusability since i feel that in some cases may not be really necessary.

### Useful resources

- [React useEffect documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html) - I had a better understanding about how useEffect works.

- [Coolors](https://www.coolors.co) - Excellent site to find matching colors.

## Acknowledgments

My main problem with this challenge is that i wanted to use an array of strings to filter the data of job offers, but due to the asynchronous nature of React at assigning values to state, the array of string woulnt update immediately, so i found a solution where i could update state by passing my array to useEffect as a second argument to make the array of strings available for the next function immediately.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
